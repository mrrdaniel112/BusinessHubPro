‚ùó **Important Security Note**: Never commit .env files or actual secret values to Git repositories. Use environment variables or a secure secrets management solution for production deployments.

## Security Guidelines Before Deployment

1. **Generate Strong Secrets**: All JWT tokens, encryption keys, and other secrets should be randomly generated.
2. **Database Security**: Ensure database connections use SSL and credentials have appropriate permissions.
3. **Implement HTTPS**: Ensure the application is served over HTTPS/TLS.
4. **Remove Test Accounts**: Remove any test, mock, or demonstration accounts before deployment.
5. **API Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints.
6. **Regular Dependency Updates**: Keep all dependencies up-to-date to avoid security vulnerabilities.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables (see above)
4. Set up the database: `npm run db:push`
